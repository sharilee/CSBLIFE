Ever since I entered college life there came a lot of changes, my role became a whole lot bigger, I have a much greater responsibility, and this is because people would start to expect something from me. Most especially my parents, for instance they trust me that IÅfm old enough to be independent. Further, my future career depends on what I start now. 
My daily routine doesnÅft go about anymore, college made me try a whole lot of stuff like waking up early, having tons of loaded homework, staying overnight to study and finish the projects, there are less time to hang out with old friends. Back in high school, I always come to school with a guardian but now, I go by myself thereÅfs a wide change in that alone. 
Entering college widen my social relationship. It is difficult to let go off your high school friends because we have the same crowd.  Our school is small; we only have one section per level. The advantage of that however is that as friends we have a deeper relationship. Unlike in college; I get to know new people, new crowd everyday. Sometimes, I doubt if I can along with them. 
I expect college to be hard because definitely there would be less time to sleep, homeworkÅfs would surely be jam packed. At first, I expect that my course, Game Design and Development would be super hard but now that I get to experience it, I know that I can strive to accomplish every task I need to do.
